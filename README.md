There are numerous ways and manners in which water can be contaminated. However, by examining
the contributing variables, we can lessen water contamination. We evaluate the waterâ€™s safety based on
variety of parameters, including pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, and solids. Sulfate, conductivity,
organic carbon, trihalomethane and turbidity. The main aim of this project is to examine whether the water
is safe for drinking or not, with the help of a machine learning model trained with a dataset which has the
factors influencing the water. The project's scope is to implement a machine learning algorithm to detect
the water quality which can be used for daily activities. To predict water safety in the future for a specific
area under certain conditions.Used only 2 classifiers those are Random Forest model and K- nearest
Neighbor and in future we can implement different other algorithms to achieve better accuracy.
